This script was created in QGIS using Model Buider.

Input data - .LAZ files. You can download these files from the following website: https://ags.cuzk.gov.cz/geoprohlizec/?atom=dmr5g

In the sample data directory, there are three .LAZ files

The results are polygons indicating areas where a ski slope can be built.

This is first prototype of the script, which means it currently works only with terraine dataset.

In the next update, vector data  will be included such as towns, existing ski slopes, roads or water bodies


This script can be run using the Model Builder. After launching the model, a dialog will appear where you can select the .LAZ files.
