This script was created in QGIS using the Model Builder tool.

Overview

The input data primarily consists of polygon layers that are the result of Script 1 - 'sjezd'. In addition, the script uses various other vector layers to define the feasible areas where a ski slope can actually be built.
Constraints Considered

The model excludes unsuitable areas by taking into account:

- Roads  
- Watercourses  
- Buildings  
- Protected areas  
- Railways

Output

The result is a set of polygons representing areas not intersecting with any of the above-mentioned constraints. These polygons mark the regions where ski slopes can potentially be constructed.

In directory sample data2, there are all used vector layers.
